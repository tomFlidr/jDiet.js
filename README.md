jDiet.js
========
Tiny browser Javascript framework for nerds, exhausted by corpulent jQuery, syntax based on jQuery, min. and gzip.: 7.23 KB, JIT

## jDiet Mission
- create very fast and comfort framework to develop my frontend javascript features (front end with IE6 (2011), IE7 (2012) and still IE8)
- keep it small as much as possible - limit - minimized and gziped to max 5 - 10 KB
- keep it cool with methods from jQuery, to create any plugins easily (galleries, lightboxes, drop down navigations, autocompletes, comboboxes to switch website language...)
- create library supporting JIT (Just Tn Time javascript compilation into bajtcode)

### jDiet Syntax
Syntax is based mostly on jQuery framework (with something more and less).
It is possible to replace jQuery with jDiet, if you are using jDiet methods only

#### The supersmart object for whole universe, when u use this framework is just:

jDiet
